# Branch Naming Convention

To maintain consistency and clarity in our repository, all feature, bugfix, or task branches must follow this naming convention:

**Pattern:** `LOBI-<ticket_number>_<description>`  
**Example:** 
`LOBI-12_bug-fix`

## 🔹 Format Breakdown

| Part | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `LOBI-` | Literal prefix identifying the project | `LOBI-` |
| `<ticket_number>` | The number of the task or ticket in the issue tracker (one or more digits) | `12`, `42` |
| `_` | Underscore separating the ticket number from the description | `_` |
| `<description>` | Short, lowercase description of the branch. Words may be separated by hyphens (`-`). **Underscores are not allowed** in the description | `bug-fix`, `add-login-feature` |
